# crisisControl

Because it's hard to write legislation that hurts your biggest donors.

## About

This code poem was born out of an increasing frustration I've felt with the US
government and how those in power handle (or don't handle) crises. A preventable
tragedy happens, members of Congress tweet out "thoughts and prayers" or "we must
do something about this", and nothing is ever done. The cycle continues.

## Code

The actual 'poem' is contained in _crisisControl.cpp_, as well as the output which
shows the officialStatement();. _lawmakers.h_ and _lawmakers.cpp_ contain
information about the class _Lawmakers_ which has functions and member variables
that serve as important parts of the poem.
